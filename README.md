# Digital Twin Manufacturing Line (VSI + SimPy)

## Overview

This project implements a **Digital Twin manufacturing line** using **Siemens Virtual Switching Interface (VSI)**.

The system is first defined using a **Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL)**, which describes the PLC, the six production stations (ST1–ST6), their signals, and their communication. After defining the DTDL, the system is implemented and executed on VSI.

The digital twin simulates a **pipeline-based production line** coordinated by a **PLC Line Coordinator**.

Each station is implemented in **Python using SimPy** and integrated through VSI using **TCP/IP communication**.

The project focuses on **modeling real PLC control behavior with predictable execution and KPI-based optimization**, rather than visual simulation only.

## Key Features

* Digital Twin Definition built first using DTDL
* Six production stations (ST1–ST6)
* Central PLC Line Coordinator
* Digital Twin that follows real PLC control logic
* Handshake-based PLC logic (ready / busy / done)
* Pipeline execution model (multiple stations can work in parallel)
* KPI monitoring from logs
* Optimization handled inside VSI

## System Architecture

* **DTDL (Digital Twin Definition Language)**
  Used as the first step to define the digital twin structure, including:

  * PLC Line Coordinator
  * Production stations (ST1–ST6)
  * Signals, ports, and communication relationships

* **VSI (Virtual Switching Interface)**
  Deploys the DTDL and manages communication between all components.

* **PLC Line Coordinator**
  Controls the production flow.
  Sends commands to stations and collects feedback signals.
  Hosts the **optimization logic** on the VSI backplane.

* **KPI Dashboard**
  Reads and processes **runtime logs** generated by:

  * the PLC Line Coordinator
  * all production stations

  KPIs are calculated from logged execution data and used for performance monitoring and analysis.

* **Production Stations (ST1–ST6)**
  Each station:

  * Waits for PLC command
  * Executes exactly once per trigger
  * Reports status and cycle time back to the PLC

## Pipeline Execution Model

The manufacturing line operates as a **pipeline**, not a sequential system.

* Multiple stations **can operate at the same time**
* Parallel execution is allowed when dependencies are satisfied
* The PLC coordinates execution to avoid:

  * Duplicate cycles
  * Race conditions
  * Uncontrolled execution

This reflects real industrial production lines.

---

## KPI Monitoring

* KPIs are generated by **reading runtime logs**
* Logs are produced by:

  * each production station
  * the PLC Line Coordinator

Examples of KPIs include:

* Station cycle times
* Station utilization
* Completed units
* Rejects and rework counts
* Throughput indicators

---

## Optimization Dashboard

The **Optimization Dashboard** is implemented **inside the PLC Line Coordinator** and runs on the **VSI backplane**.

* Uses live PLC signals and KPI data
* Supports:

  * Performance analysis
  * Bottleneck detection
  * Optimization decisions
* Allows configuration of factory parameters such as:

  * downtime limits
  * buffer sizes

Optimization is handled internally by the PLC.

---

## Communication

* Protocol: **TCP/IP**
* VSI-native Python gateways are used
* Communication flow:

  * PLC → Station: control commands
  * Station → PLC: status signals and cycle times

---

## Limitations

* No physical hardware integration
* Results depend on simulation accuracy and modeled timing
* Network behavior is simulated
